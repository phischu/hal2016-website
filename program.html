<h3 id="russo">Preserving Privacy with Monads</h3>
<p><em>by <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/">Alejandro Russo</a></em></p>
<p>In a all-connected society, users consciously (or unconsciously) value their privacy. Even skeptical people will recognize its importance; if they do not, ask them to unlock their smartphone and hand it out to someone else—they will most probably refuse! Users want to have control on how their data gets disseminated, specially today when private information gets handled by software with heterogeneous trustworthiness—consider, for example, the various smartphones apps with access to users’ private photos, messages, and contacts that exists today. Unfortunately, current software practices are insufficient to protect privacy: users who wish to benefit from software functionality are often forced to grant access to their private data with no guarantees how it gets handled. The key insight to guarantee privacy is not about granting or denying access to private data, but ensuring that information only flows into the appropriated places.</p>
<p>Information-Flow Control (IFC) is a research area dedicated to protect privacy of data. Based on programming languages techniques, IFC scrutinizes source code to track how data of different sensitivity levels (e.g., public or private) flows within a program, where alarms are raised when privacy might be at stake. IFC tools often provide specially designed compilers to build privacy-preserving apps. Rather than building a compiler from scratch (a major task on its own), Haskell plays a unique privileged role in this scenario: it can provide IFC security via libraries. As long as developers program against the libraries’ API, code is secure by construction. This talk shows how to build such libraries by specially designing monads capable to restrict the propagation of private data. The presentation explores the different techniques used in a wide range of libraries, namely LIO, MAC, and HLIO, where IFC is enforced dynamically (in the form of an execution monitor), statically (by leveraging Haskell’s type-system), and as a combination of both.</p>
<p><strong>Short bio</strong>: [Alejandro Russo] is an associate professor at Chalmers University of Technology working on the intersection of functional languages, security, and systems. He is the recipient of a Google Research Awards and several grants from the Swedish research agencies Vetenskapsrådet, STINT, and Barbro Osher foundation. Internationally, Prof. Russo worked on prestigious research institutions like Stanford University, where he was appointed visiting associate professor. His research ranges from foundational aspects of security to developing tools to secure software written in Haskell, Python, and JavaScript.</p>

<h3 id="thielemann">Efficient signal processing using Haskell and LLVM</h3>
<p><em>by <a href="http://dr.henning-thielemann.de/">Henning Thielemann</a></em></p>
<p>Haskell has so many features that are useful for signal processing: Lazy evaluation allows for infinite lists, simultaneous processing of a sequence of signal transformations and feedback, monads allow for proper handling of coherent and incoherent sources of noise, the type system allows for handling of sample rates via phantom types and for hiding internal filter parameters in opaque types. However, especially when relying on a lot of laziness your Haskell programs will be pretty slow in any Haskell implementation. In order to get reasonable processing speed you need to switch from lazy lists of sampled displacements to lazy lists of chunks of unboxed arrays. This compromise is pretty close to how signals are usually stored in signal processing packages written in machine oriented languages. However, GHC still fails to generate efficient code in cases that are hard to predict. It may be due to missing inlining, too much sharing of functions or too much laziness.</p>
<p>With the package <code>synthesizer-llvm</code> we address the issue of efficient signal processing. We use the LLVM Just-In-Time compiler in order to perform signal processing with maximum speed. LLVM provides optimization passes and vector instructions that enable us to achieve this goal. Our package also provides the programmer precise control over strict evaluation, code and data duplication or sharing.</p>
<p>In the tutorial we examine the examples included in the package, experiment with them and learn about the basic concepts of the package this way. The examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal producers like oscillators and noise generator,</li>
<li>Frequency filters and how to work with internal filter parameters beyond the restricting scheme of audio and control rates found in other digital signal processing frameworks,</li>
<li>Sample value types: Stereo sounds, binary logic signals, fixed-size arrays</li>
<li>Causal signal processes with arrows, sharing and feedback with proven absence of deadlocks,</li>
<li>Express arrows by plain functions,</li>
<li>Composing sequences of sounds, composing music from tones,</li>
<li>MIDI control of sounds,</li>
<li>Integration with ALSA and JACK,</li>
<li>Vectorisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I already gave a tutorial on LLVM at <a href="https://iba-cg.de/hal9.html">HaL-9</a> and chose simple signal processing as application. In this tutorial I will ignore the details of LLVM and just concentrate on the signal processing part. I do not plan to give an extensive introduction to signal processing, the focus is on how to get things done with <code>synthesizer-llvm</code>.</p>
<p>Since LLVM changes slightly with every release my LLVM bindings got a bit out of date. I am currently updating them. The tricky part to install is the package <code>llvm-ffi</code>. If you want to attend the tutorial and want to code with us, please send me your e-mail. I will then notify you when my packages are ready for installation and I will give you hints on the installation.</p>
